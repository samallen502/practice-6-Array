Inspired by Dave McFarlane's work at:
https://teamtreehouse.com/library/accessing-items-in-an-array

The purpose of this exercise was to show how items in an array can be
accessed.

Recommended:
1) Review shopping.js
2) Execute index.html with Google Chrome
3) Type CTRL+SHIFT+J to open Chrome Developer Tools, where the shopping
list will be printed to the console.

(You could just as easily have printed the shopping list to the screen
using document.write or by passing similar commands.)
